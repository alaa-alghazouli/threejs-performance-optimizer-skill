## Positioning

Core message:

"A docs-aligned AI skill that optimizes Three.js and React Three Fiber with a measurable, profile-first workflow."

## Twitter/X post template

"I just open-sourced `brainkit`: an npm-installable AI toolkit repository. It currently includes `threejs-performance-optimizer` for fixing low FPS, draw-call bottlenecks, memory leaks, and R3F jank in Three.js projects.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/alaa-alghazouli/brainkit\nInstall: npm install brainkit-ai\n\n#threejs #reactthreefiber #webgl #webgpu #opensource #ai #npm"

## LinkedIn post template

"I published `brainkit`, an open-source npm package for AI-ready skill/tool bundles. The first included skill, `threejs-performance-optimizer`, focuses on practical 3D performance engineering for Three.js and React Three Fiber.\n\nWhat it does:\n- Diagnoses CPU/GPU/memory/loading bottlenecks\n- Prioritizes optimizations in ROI order\n- Produces measurable before/after guidance\n- Prevents outdated API recommendations\n\nRepository: https://github.com/alaa-alghazouli/brainkit\nPackage: https://www.npmjs.com/package/brainkit-ai"

## Reddit post angles

- r/threejs: "Open-source skill for Three.js perf audits (draw calls, shadows, memory leaks, loading)"
- r/reactjs or r/reactthreefiber: "R3F optimization skill with anti-pattern guardrails"
- r/webdev: "Practical workflow for profiling and optimizing WebGL/WebGPU scenes"

## Hacker News title ideas

## Product Hunt listing draft

- Tagline: "AI skill for faster Three.js and R3F apps"
- One-liner: "Diagnose and fix 3D web performance bottlenecks with a profile-first workflow."
- Key bullets:
  - Draw-call and scene complexity optimization
  - Asset pipeline tuning with Draco/KTX2 guidance
  - Memory leak and disposal audit patterns

## Dev.to / Hashnode article outline

1. Why Three.js performance advice often fails
2. The bottleneck-first framework
3. Real examples: draw calls, R3F state jank, memory cleanup
4. How this skill prevents stale API guidance
5. How to contribute and extend

## 30-day promotion cadence

- Week 1: launch posts and release thread
- Week 2: publish one deep-dive optimization case study
- Week 3: post a short demo video and R3F-specific tips thread
- Week 4: publish update release notes and invite contributions
